# Final-Project
CSC 212 Spring 2022 Final Project Source Code

# To compile & run the source code:
Download: the files from github.
Simply use: "g++ main.cpp Algs.cpp -o main && ./main". It should compile if done properly and you're off and running!


# Our Contributions:

  Jake and Brendan came up with the layout of the code using a class for the sorting functions. Jake implemented the layout and insertion sort algorithm. Brendan implemented the quicksort algorithm. Brian implemented the radix sort algorithm. He searched and found multiple sorting algorithms and found radix to be the most interesting one. Rushad implemented the merge sort algorithm. Jake wrote the majority of this report and wrote the insertion sort section. He also created a separate program printing timestamps to an output file to time insertion sort and radix sort algorithms to graph them and provide visualization. For merge sort and quick, he benchmarked them using the source code and graphed them for a similar visual. Brendan contributed to the quick sort section. Brian also contributed to the quick sort section. Brendan created the majority of the presentation and wrote about the quick sort algorithm. Jake, Brian, and Rushad wrote about insertion sort, radix sort, and merge sort respectively.
