# Final-Project
CSC 212 Spring 2022 Final Project Source Code

# To compile & run the source code:
Download: the files from github.
Simply use: "g++ main.cpp Algs.cpp -o main && ./main". It should compile if done properly and you're off and running!


# Our Contributions:

  Jake and Brendan came up with the layout of the code using a class for the sorting functions. Jake implemented the layout and insertion sort algorithm. Brendan implemented the quicksort algorithm. Brian implemented the radix sort algorithm. He searched and found multiple sorting algorithms and found radix to be the most interesting one. Rushad implemented the merge sort algorithm and time complexity and also helped with the graphs for visualization. Jake wrote the majority of the report and wrote the insertion sort section. He also created a separate program printing timestamps to an output file to time the insertion sort algorithm to graph them and provide visualization. For merge sort, quick, and radix, he benchmarked them using the source code and graphed them for a similar visual. Brendan contributed to the quicksort section. Brian contributed to the radix sort section. Rushad created and presented the slides on merge sort. Brendan created the majority of the presentation and wrote about the quicksort algorithm. Jake, Brian, and Rushad wrote about insertion sort, radix sort, and merge sort respectively.
